Hello, we’re Andrea, Max, Mike and Parteek.

The scenario: you’re greeting an acquaintance. She extends her arm out at an ambiguous angle and all of a sudden you’re not sure if she’s going for a fist bump, handshake, or hey, maybe even a full-on hug. You bungle the gesture, she looks at you funny, and things get awkward.

We’d like to spare you that embarrassment, so we made something for you.

It’s called Interaction Time.

It’s is a four-person role playing game that enables players to practice the art of the Interaction Ritual. Two teams of two face off to see which team can identify and complete the most Social Interaction Gestures in a set amount of time.

The iPhones display one of five interactions: fist bump, handshake, bro hug, high five and the standard hug.

The objective is to successfully telegraph.

Doing so will score them a point for their round. Which ever team scores the most points wins.

This was written in less than 48 hours at our favorite hackathon, iOSDevCamp.
